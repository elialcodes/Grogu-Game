## Grogu Game :rocket: 🪐 :dizzy: :frog: :clapper: 


Let's play with Grogu!
Welcome to this easy and simple game inspired by The Mandalorian series where you just have to be lucky. Madalorian is the protector of Grogu, a little bug that must be taken to his planet to be with his own kind. But Grogu is very greedy and wants to finish with the food of the spaceship. You will have to help Mandalorian to keep the food in a cupboard so that it is safe.

To do this, roll the dice to get a random number from 1 to 4 and you will unload the food while Grogu advances, you will have to be faster than him!

- 4: Grogu will advance 1 square
